## Discuss how local media environment moderates the perception of locals on economic activitist of China. 

We don't have the money/time to fill survey experiments. We may leverage existing cross-national survey data (Afrobarometer or Central and Eastern Eurobarometer (CEEB) surveys).

Citizens form opinions about foreign powers/actiities partly from local media reports. Xinhua, in partiular, has expanded its power on local media in many African countries. 

## Timing of the launch of projects and cross-national surveys

Miles cites a recent working paper that looks at the announcement of World Bank Project as different treatment. The authors map them with the World Value Surveys and see how the immigration flows change, to infer how much confidence they have on their home country's economic prosperity. 

We can use the same approach to leverage Xinhua's release of news reports on projects/loans/FDI/aids as treatments and match them with surveys. 

One caveat is that the frequency of surveys may be low, but we need to check the survey sources.
Another possibility is to compare Chinese financing with others, such as the US.
