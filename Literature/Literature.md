## 1. McCauley et al. 2022 Chinese and US FDI in Africa

They geolocated 750 FDI from Chinese and US firms and show how African citizens perceive the influences of Chinese firms versus US firms in competition. They find that proximity to US FDI projecs increases perceptions that the US is the most influential country, but the influence from Chinese inverstment projects is offseted by the US -- most of which are co-located with US projects. However, respondents who live close to the Chinese (US) FDI projects are *less* likely to view the Chinese (US) model as the best approach for development in their country, and *more* likely to view the US (Chinese) model as such.
