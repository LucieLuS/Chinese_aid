## 01. McCauley et al. 2022 Chinese and US FDI in Africa

RQ: How does US and Chinese FDI affect the perceived influence of these two countries, and how does it affect their appea?

Summary: 

They geolocated 750 FDI from Chinese and US firms and show how African citizens perceive the influences of Chinese firms versus US firms in competition. They find that proximity to US FDI projecs increases perceptions that the US is the most influential country, but the influence from Chinese inverstment projects is offseted by the US -- most of which are co-located with US projects. However, respondents who live close to the Chinese (US) FDI projects are *less* likely to view the Chinese (US) model as the best approach for development in their country, and *more* likely to view the US (Chinese) model as such.

Theory: proximity to FDI projects increase visibility and awareness ---> when observing investing firms from multiple major powers, there are substitution effects. (Foreign power's gains in influence come at the expense of others.)

Contribute to the literature of soft power, why local citizens' perceptions matter in the accumulation of soft power; the first study to spatially connect Chinese and US FDI to the influence of those foreign powers in domestic settings.

Data sources: 
- Financial Tim'es *fDi Markets* database in 2010-2019 and extract the geolocation of the FDI projects, resulting in 208 Chinese FDI projects and 550 US FDI projects
- Surveys: Afrobarometer, conducted every 2-3 years in up to 38 African countries. (Round 6: 2014-2015, 23 countries, 37,150 respondents)


Identification strategy: 

The timing of the survey data are matched with existing FDI projects that were operational as well as eventual projects that did not exist but that would enter the dataset in subequent years.

Leveraged news sourecs to determine the GPS point coordinates of the FDI project. "In the area" == within 25 km of a precise location. They identify those residing in the area. Afrobarometer respondents also have time and space information.

Overall, 34\% of respondents live near an active US project are proximate to both US and Chinese FDI projects, whereas 69\% newr Chinese FDI live near co-located US and Chinese projects.

Research Design:

Compare respondents living in proximity to an active Chinese or US project, and eventual project location, and no project yet exists. The intuition is that respondents living near active projects and eventual project locations are similar in expectation.
